# About

The Atlas of Inequality is a project from the [Social Urban Networks](https://socialurban.net) group at Northeastern Network Science group and the Human Dynamics group at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).

It is part of a broader initiative to understand human behavior in our cities and how large-scale problems like transportation, housing, segregation or inequality depend in part on the emergent patterns of people's individual opportunities and choices.
